# SIGNLINGO
Sign Language Translation System (Mini-project for college)\n\n

Project Overview\n
Our project focuses on creating a computer system that can seamlessly translate between American Sign Language (ASL) and Indian Sign Language (ISL) using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Despite the similarities between ASL and ISL, their distinct words, sentence structures, and rules present significant translation challenges.\n\n
    
Impact\n
By implementing this system, we aim to facilitate communication for sign language users and advance technology in sign language translation. This project aspires to enhance accessibility and bridge communication gaps for people who rely on ASL and ISL.\n\n

Future Scope and Enhancements\n
--> Support additional sign languages like BSL and LSF.\n
-->Enable instant translation for live conversations and video calls.\n
-->Integrate smart glasses and sensor-equipped gloves.\n
-->Implement a system for users to report errors and suggest improvements.\n
-->Incorporate cultural contexts and region-specific signs.\n
-->Develop modules for learning ASL and ISL or other sign languages.\n
